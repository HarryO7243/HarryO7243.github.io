    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I knew a little about Python coding but I only knew the basics.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete the tasks on classroom e.g. make a piece of code that asks for a username and password then checks them off a known list of entries.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No, as I didn't finish the task although I did make a good effort towards it.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using my other pieces of Python as reference to what I should write. I also asked the people around me for help as well as the teacher. I looked at online resources as well when I wasn't sure on how to approach a certain problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel that not knowing all of the necessary code limited how I could approach problems. I didn’t know about classes so I found a different way that wasn’t efficient but it still worked. I need to learn more about python so that i can apply it in future pieces of code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I am going to spend more time in the lesson planning what I was going to do then use the plans so that I could make a piece of code for homework.</td>
