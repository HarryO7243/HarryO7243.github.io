  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by asking other people when I wasn't sure and also by thinking logically. The game was more of a logic puzzle with extra pieces of code to make it more of a challenge. Some levels were easier than others but the harder ones took some time to complete.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I donâ€™t think that anything limited my learning as I worked through the levels and asked for help when I needed it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to work quicker during the levels so I can get more done during the lesson.</td>
