  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by making notes. Previously I had written down the instructions on what I had to do and in the lesson I had followed them. I also learnt by asking others when my notes were not sufficient. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I had a music lesson before the lesson so when I joined the rest of the class, I was already far behind. I Feel that apart from that, nothing else limited my learning.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There is not much I can change for next time. However, I could improve on not asking others for help and looking it up online.</td>
