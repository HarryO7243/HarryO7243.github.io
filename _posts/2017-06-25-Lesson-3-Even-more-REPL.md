  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had created a bit of code that partially worked but it didn't fulfil the brief.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try to complete the task as efficiently as possible with as little code as possible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I didnâ€™t complete the task so I will try to complete it for homework.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt listening to the teacher when they made points for us to improve on. I also asked others around me for help when I wasn't sure and I also looked things up. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was not knowing how to do certain things. I should think more logically about problems and plan how I am going to complete the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will need to plan what I am going to so that I can apply it in the code. There is not much else I can change for next time I feel. </td>
  </tr>
