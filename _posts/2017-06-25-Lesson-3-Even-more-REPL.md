  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt  by focusing on my own work and also by helping other. I focused on my own work at the start of the lesson. When I was almost done with the work, I decided to help others around me. I learnt by helping others as they had a different code to me which helped to make my code better. I then used some of their code to help my work. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning apart from not knowing all of the code and that it was harder to ask for help. The teacher was away and so we had a cover teacher for that lesson. This meant that if I had a problem, then they wouldn't be able to help me. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will look up certain pieces of code in advance and then apply that learning into my own work.</td>
